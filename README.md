# solo-gachibuy

There are many shopping list apps out there but not one with the capabilities of sharing that list with multiple users.
This mobile-first web application is a shopping list application that would allow users to login, create a group and add other users. Users can now create a shared list of shopping items, update when an item has been bought and delete once the shopping trip is over.
